    <p>This animation is my contribution to a larger group project, a culmination of many dinosaur-themed clips called "The Last Day". With similar themes and the same impending meteor, each clip showed a dinosaur or group of dinosaurs spending their last day on Earth before the meteor overhead hits the planet. For me, within this project I focused on character design with my family of Velociraptors, connecting joints and learning how best to smoothly and effectively show character movement. Through this project I was able to gain experience coordinating with a group about every aspect of the idea, research and final animation.</p>
