    <p>Hello, I'm Lindsay Constantino, a current 3rd year New Media Design student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Although I am in Rochester for school, I am originally from Buffalo, New York. I'm a firm believer in living life to the fullest and without regrets, trying to gain as much knowledge as I can. I have a passion for art and design, venturing into every creative field that has interested me. Whether it be baking, making balloon animals, knitting, painting or learning the ukulele, I have tried to learn almost everything that has peaked my interest. My passion for these artistic fields led me to the wide area of New Media Design and UI/UX design, learning to bridge the gap between product and user through visual design, animation and coding.</p>
