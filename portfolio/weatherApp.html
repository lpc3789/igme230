    <h4>iPhone Weather App Redesign</h4>
    <img class="pagePhoto" src="weatherApp.jpg">
    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <p>In an effort to research various visual design trends I chose to redesign the iPhone weather app with the objective of applying these trends to one similar design. Throughout my design processes, I realized that each design style came with it's own set of strengths and weaknesses. I also learned how to combat various problems a user and creator could run into when using or designing in one of these styles.</p>
    <h5>Visual Style 1</h5>
    <p>My first screen idea was very childish and whimsical. Through sticker-like graphics and light colors I wanted to emphasize the playful and cartoony personality of the app. The hanging graphics on top of the screen give the feeling of a stage play or a storybook and gives the application more dimension with the use of drop-shadows.</p>
    <h5>Visual Style 2</h5>
    <p>My second screen is focused on current 2018 trends, such as material design, bold colors and subtle gradients. One thing I had to keep in mind with this design was knowing what was too bold or too extravagant. I had to pay extra attention to whether or not I was overwhelming the viewer.</p>
    <h5>Visual Style 3</h5>
    <p>My third screen shows a very different style from the first two in that it shows a much a more sleek, modern and overall mature feel. I wanted this design to be completely black and white from the beginning. I wanted show a clear hierarchy with the information provided in the top section of the app. This weather app places the focus on the information being shown rather than bright or flashy graphics or illustrations.</p>
