    <h5>WITR 89.7</h5>
    <p>This first poster I created for my campus radio station WITR 89.7, where I work as the Assistant Events Coordinator. I really enjoyed creating this poster because of my love for the station, and I was also able to gain valuable experience using a preset style guide provided by the radio station, sticking to the brand's specific fonts, colors and styles.</p>

    <h5>#RebuildRockport</h5>
    <p>These next three posters were created for Rockport, Texas to show my support in their efforts to rebuild after the disastrous events of Hurricane Harvey. With these posters I was able to focus on visual graphics and work in different styles with varying degrees of dimension.</p>
