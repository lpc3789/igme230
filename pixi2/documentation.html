        <h3>Audience and Goals</h3>
        <p>Usually these types of games are targeted towards younger girls but I want this collection of games to be enjoyed by all ages. My main audience for this project are my friends, classmates and professor. What I wanted to accomplish with these games was drag and drop interactivity using graphics I created. The games would increase in complexity, adding more characters and more clothing options to drag and drop.</p>
        <h3>Initial Sketches</h3>

        <h3>Sources</h3>
        <p>All of the characters and graphics I used were created by me. I used a lot of tutorials to help me with drag and drop functionality:</p>

        </ol>
        <h3>My Process and Problems</h3>
        <p>Originally I had attempted to use PIXI.JS to add the drag and drop functionality to my project, but I had a lot of problems getting it to work. It took me a couple days to even get the library to link to my files properly, and when I was able to get the drag and drop functionality working, the sprites were not able to be incorporated into my grid and would load in one place on the screen even when the browser was resized. After this I tried to use D3.JS but also ran into a few roadblocks. I was, again, able to get the drag and drop functionality working but the images were only visible in the parent container and could not be moved onto the other parts of the canvas. After spending a while playing with svgs and their properties I decided to scale back my project and go back to PIXI.JS which I feel has the best drag and drop functionality.</p>
